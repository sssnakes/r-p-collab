    <p class="intro-text">Hey! Thanks for stopping by.
</br></br>
We're Rachel and Pierre. A new creative duo, who've come together over a shared appreciation of the way each other's brains work.
</br></br>
He thinks she's a sarcastic know-it-all Londoner. (Which she is.)
</br></br>
And she thinks he's a chilled out do-gooder French surfer. Which he is!
</br></br>
Combined, they've worked at VICE Media, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Sydney, Unseen Photo Fair, Havas Worldwide London and Happiness Brussels. He's started his own sustainable surf apparel brand and she's co-created denim brand Hadaka Denim and curated art exhibitions.
</br></br>
Available to add some spice to projects, from brand and agency work to any other creative opportunities you'd like our input on. Like the sound of us? Get in touch!</p>
