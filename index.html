      </br></br>
        Our aim is to make work that's informative and entertaining and helps brands grow, whilst staying relevant. We'll do this whilst stuffing our faces with 🍕

        We're available for brand and agency work or any other creative opportunities you'd like our input on. Like the sound of us?

    <p>Salut, I'm Pierre. A French creative with an interest in art, design, and our future.
      </br></br>
    I've worked in the creative industry for 7 years. Full-time for advertising agencies like Havas Worldwide London and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Sydney. More recently, I've been freelancing for agencies in Paris and London.
      </br></br>
    I'm keen on projects involving conceptual thinking, art direction, photography and design. I believe in ideas that help brands make a cultural impact, in whatever shape or size. I've worked on multiple integrated campaigns and pitches. I once dressed up a teenager in a giant sloth suit and blew up the internet. A few months after that, I made what was recognised as the most innovative piece of work to come out of Australia that year. If you want to hear more stories, please contact me here and we can get talking.
